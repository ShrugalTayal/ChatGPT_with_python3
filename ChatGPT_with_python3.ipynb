        "# Using ChatGPT with Python3: A Beginner's Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3 language model, specifically designed for conversational language generation. To use ChatGPT in Python, you will need to install the OpenAI API client and obtain an API key. You can use the `openai.api_request()` function provided by the OpenAI Python library to send the request to the ChatGPT model ¹. OpenAI’s ChatGPT models are designed to generate text in response to user prompts, making them ideal for use in chatbot and virtual assistant applications ².\n",
