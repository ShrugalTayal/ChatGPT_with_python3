# Using ChatGPT with Python3: A Beginner's Guide

ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3 language model, specifically designed for conversational language generation. To use ChatGPT in Python, you will need to install the OpenAI API client and obtain an API key. You can use the `openai.api_request()` function provided by the OpenAI Python library to send the request to the ChatGPT model [¹](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-use-openais-chatgpt-model-in-python-by-chatgpt-fe5040f61c70). OpenAI’s ChatGPT models are designed to generate text in response to user prompts, making them ideal for use in chatbot and virtual assistant applications [²](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-simple-guide-to-chatgpt-api-with-python-c147985ae28).

## Installation

To install the OpenAI API client library for Python, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install openai
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of using ChatGPT with Python:

```python
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = "<your-api-key>"

# Set up the model and prompt
model_engine = "text-davinci-003"
prompt = "Hello, how are you today?"

# Generate a response
completion = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.5,
)

# Received response from ChatGPT
response = completion.choices[0].text
print(response)
```

Remember to replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual OpenAI API key.
